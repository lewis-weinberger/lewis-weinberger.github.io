        <p>After participating in IBM’s
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/master-the-mainframe">Master the Mainframe</a>
competition (which gives users access to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/MGYBLW61">z14</a>
machine running <a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/os">z/OS</a>), I was
keen to learn more about mainframes. Compared to a lot of computing hardware
these days, mainframes are still very much the domain of large corporate entities
such as banks, so emulation is probably the most accessible way to spin up your
own big iron. However, getting a personal copy of the proprietory z/OS is expensive
(although there are options such as
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSTQBD_12.0.0/com.ibm.zdt.install.doc/topics/zdt_pe.html">ZD&amp;T</a>).
Fortunately, some of the older IBM operating systems are now in the public domain,
including MVS (<em>Multiple Virtual Storage</em>) up to version 3.8j. In this blog post I
will detail my experience with setting up an emulator called
<a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/">Hercules</a> to run an MVS distrubtion, and some of the
fun I’ve had compiling and running programs on my own mainframe.</p>
<p>I should note that there are many useful resources out there which go into more detail
than I will, covering all things mainframe; in particular I highly recommend the
YouTube channel of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/moshe5760/featured">moshix</a> for some
excellent tutorials on using Hercules and MVS.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>The first commerically available mainframe was the
<a href="https://www.thocp.net/hardware/univac.htm">UNIVAC I</a> made in 1951. IBM’s first
mainframes were the
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ibm700series/transform/">700 series</a>,
led by the IBM 701 scientific computer released in 1952. Unlike modern supercomputer
clusters (such as the IBM-built <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/">Summit</a>), the mainframe
has historically been targeted at high-throughput computing (HTC) rather than
high-performance computing (HPC). For example, mainframes have been adopted throughout the
finance and banking industry to provide reliable transaction services.</p>
<p>In this post we will be emulating the IBM 3033 hardware, running the MVS operating system.
First announced in 1977 and referred to as “<em>The Big One</em>”, the 3033 processor boasted a
CPU cycle time of 58 ns (about 17 MHz).</p>
<p><img src="../images/IBM_3033_with_users.jpg" class="centre" alt="IBM 3033" /><br />

<p>Image from the IBM Corporate Archives<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> showing some users interacting with an IBM 3033
mainframe. For more information about mainframes and IBM’s role in their development, I
highly recommend visiting their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/index.html">Coporate Archives page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-hercules-and-mvs-3.8j-turnkey">Setting up Hercules and MVS 3.8j Turnkey</h3>
<p>In what follows I will try to keep the information host-system-agnostic,
because in theory the Hercules emulator should run on UNIX-like (e.g.
Linux, MacOS, etc.) and Windows systems alike. To get started we will
need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>install <a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercinst.html">Hercules</a> on the host system,</li>
<li>download the <a href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/">MVS 3.8j Turnkey 4-</a> distribution,</li>
<li>install a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270">3270</a> terminal emulator.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hercules webpage has detailed instructions for installing the emulator
on different host systems. The MVS distribution that we will be using was
originally created by Volke Banke, including all the necessary software and
Hercules integration to run MVS out-of-the-box. This distribution has then
been updated and further automated by Juergen Winkelmann. Make sure to
download the “<a href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/tk4-_v1.00_current.zip">Current TK4-</a>”
version, as this has all the latest patches pre-installed. Finally, in order
to interact with your emulated mainframe you will need an emulator for the
3270 IBM terminal. There are a number of options out there for this, I’m
using <a href="http://x3270.bgp.nu/">x3270</a>. I recommend having a look through the
<a href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/MVS_TK4-_v1.00_Users_Manual.pdf">Turnkey User Manual</a>
before starting.</p>
<p>The good news is that the MVS Turnkey distribution is extremely well integrated
with Hercules, and all of the IPL’ing (<em>Initial Program Load</em>, c.f. bootloading)
has been automated for us. Practically speaking, this means you should be able
to boot up your mainframe just by using the provided <code>mvs</code> scripts in the
<code>tk4-</code> directory (<code>mvs.bat</code> for Windows users, and the shell script <code>mvs</code> for
*nix users). After starting these scripts from the command prompt of your
choosing, you will see lots of start-up messages printed to the console.
Hopefully you should eventually see the following, which means you are ready
to logon to your system:</p>

<p>At this point you can fire up your 3270 emulator, and point it to connect
to port 3270 on your machine (e.g. <code>localhost:3270</code>, or <code>127.0.0.1:3270</code>).
As the first user logging on to the system you will need to press the <code>RESET</code>
and <code>CLEAR</code> keys on your 3270 emulator in order to be presented with a logon
prompt. Note: the 3270 terminal had a number of keys that may not be present
on your modern keyboard, so the emulator that you use may have special
keybindings in order to use them.</p>
<p>We are going to use the <code>HERC02</code> default user (password <code>CUL8TR</code>):</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>Logon ===&gt; HERC02

ENTER CURRENT PASSWORD FOR HERC02-
CUL8TR</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Having successfully logged on to TSO (<em>Time Sharing Option</em>), you will be
presented with a little menu of TSO Applications. Choose option 1, RFE
(<em>REVIEW Front End</em>), by hitting enter on:</p>
<pre><code>Option ===&gt; 1</code></pre>
<p>From here we’re ready to start playing with our mainframe!</p>
<h3 id="getting-around-the-system-with-rfe">Getting around the system with RFE</h3>
<p>TSO is a system that allows multiple users to access and use a mainframe
simultaneously. Much like UNIX, it provides a command line for submitting
programs for execution. However, it is generally more convenient to use a
<em>productivity tool</em> to interact with the system. These tools are a text-based
user interface somewhere in between the command-line and a full windowing
graphical user interface. Users of modern z/OS systems may be familiar in
particular with <code>ISPF</code> (<em>Interactive System Productivity Facility</em>) and <code>SDSF</code>
(<em>System Display and Search Facility</em>), however these are both proprietory IBM
programs which require a license. We will instead be using an open source
facility maintained by Greg Price called <code>REVIEW</code>, and we will interact with
it using the front-end <code>RFE</code>:</p>
<p><img src="../images/using_RFE.png" class="centre" alt="Using RFE" /><br />
</p>
<p>As you can see from the RFE main menu, we can use this program to manage
our files (called <em>Data sets</em> in mainframe jargon) as well as execute our
programs on TSO.</p>
<h3 id="next-time-update-april-10-2021">Next time… [UPDATE: April 10 2021]</h3>
<p>I was originally planning to write further posts to describe my
experiences getting set up with some of the compilers that come with the
Turnkey distribution: using them to write, compile and run some fun
programs written in FORTRAN IV, COBOL and C. Unfortunately life and the
pandemic got in the way, so it may be some time before I return to
this project.</p>
