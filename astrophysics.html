    <P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>: We explore a potential new probe of
    reionization: the cross-correlation of high-redshift galaxies with maps of
    the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. We consider two types of high
    redshift galaxies: Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman-α emitters
    (LAEs). LBGs and LAEs will be detected in large numbers at high redshift
    (z ~ 4 to 7) by ongoing and future surveys. We consider a LBG sample like
    that expected from the The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and
    Time (LSST), and a selection of LAEs modelled after the Subaru SILVERRUSH
    program, but covering a much larger sky fraction. The tSZ effect is
    sensitive to a line-of-sight integral of the ionized gas pressure, and can
    be measured across large patches of the sky using multi-frequency CMB
    surveys. We consider forecast tSZ maps from CMB Stage 4 and more
    futuristic observations. Using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we
    show that the high-redshift galaxies are correlated with the tSZ signal
    from reionization, with cross-power amplitude of order 10−15 at l∼1000.
    The cross-spectra between LBGs/LAEs with tSZ maps contain information
    about the reionization history of the Universe, such as the distribution
    of bubble sizes, and could in principle be used to directly measure the
    timing of reionization. The amplitude of the signal is small, however, and
    its detectability is hindered by low-redshift contributions to tSZ maps
    and by instrumental noise. If the the low-redshift contribution to the
    observed tSZ signal is suppressed by masking of massive halos, a
    combination of overlapping futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys could
    potentially probe this signal.</P>

    <P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>: We model the 21-cm signal and LAE population
    evolution during the epoch of reionization in order to predict the
    21cm-LAE cross-power spectrum. We employ high-dynamic-range simulations of
    the IGM to create models that are consistent with constraints from the
    CMB, Lyman-α forest and LAE population statistics. Using these models we
    consider the evolution of the cross-power spectrum for a selection of
    realistic reionization histories and predict the sensitivity of current
    and upcoming surveys to measuring this signal. We find that the imprint of
    a delayed-end to reionization can be observed by future surveys, and that
    strong constraints can be placed on the progression of reionization as
    late as z = 5.7 using a Subaru-SKA survey. We make predictions for the
    signal-to-noise ratios achievable by combinations of Subaru/PFS with the
    MWA, LOFAR, HERA and SKA interferometers for an integration time of 1000
    hours. We find that a Subaru-SKA survey could measure the cross-power
    spectrum for a late reionization at z = 6.6 with a total signal-to-noise
    greater than 5, making it possible to constrain both the timing and bubble
    size at the end of reionization. Furthermore, we find that expanding the
    current Subaru/PFS survey area and depth by a factor of three would double
    the total signal-to-noise.</P>

    <P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>: A long (110 cMpc/h) and deep absorption
    trough in the Lyα forest has been observed extending down to redshift 5.5
    in the spectrum of ULAS J0148+0600. Although no Lyα transmission is
    detected, Lyβ spikes are present which has led to claims that the gas
    along this trough must be ionized. Using high resolution cosmological
    radiative transfer simulations in large volumes, we show that in a
    scenario where reionization ends late z ~ 5.2, our simulations can
    reproduce troughs as long as observed. In this model, we find that the
    troughs are caused by islands of neutral hydrogen. Small ionized holes
    within the neutral islands allow for the transmission of Lyβ. We have also
    modelled the Lyα emitter population around the simulated troughs, and show
    that there is a deficit of Lyα emitters close to the trough as is
    observed.</P>

    <P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>: We model the high-redshift (z &gt; 5)
    Ly α-emitting galaxy (LAE) population using the empirical rest-frame
    equivalent width distribution. We calibrate to the observed luminosity
    function and angular correlation function at z = 5.7 as measured by the
    SILVERRUSH survey. This allows us to populate the high-dynamic-range
    Sherwood simulation suite with LAEs, and to calculate the transmission of
    their Ly α emission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use this
    simulated population to explore the effect of the IGM on high-redshift
    observations of LAEs, and make predictions for the narrow-band filter
    redshifts at z = 6.6, 7.0, and 7.3. Comparing our model with existing
    observations, we find a late reionization is suggested, consistent with
    the recent low optical depth derived from the cosmic microwave background
    by the Planck collaboration and the opacity fluctuations in the Ly α
    forest. We also explore the role of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and
    the large volume of gas that is infalling on to the host halo versus the
    IGM in attenuating the Ly α signal, finding that a significant fraction of
    the attenuation is due to the CGM and infalling gas, which increases
    towards the end of reionization, albeit with a large scatter across the
    mock LAE population.</P>

    <P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>: We model the transmission of the Lyman-alpha
    line through the circum- and intergalactic media around dark matter haloes
    expected to host Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z &gt; 5.7, using the
    high-dynamic-range Sherwood simulations. We find very different CGM
    environments around more massive haloes compared to less massive haloes at
    these redshifts, which can contribute to a different evolution of the
    Lyman-alpha transmission from LAEs within these haloes. Additionally we
    confirm that part of the differential evolution could result from bright
    LAEs being more likely to reside in larger ionized regions. We conclude
    that a combination of the CGM environment and the IGM ionization structure
    is likely to be responsible for the differential evolution of the bright
    and faint ends of the LAE luminosity function at z &gt; 6. More generally,
    we confirm the suggestion that the self-shielded neutral gas in the
    outskirts of the host halo can strongly attenuate the Lyman-alpha emission
    from high redshift galaxies. We find that this has a stronger effect on
    the more massive haloes hosting brighter LAEs. The faint-end of the LAE
    luminosity function is thus a more reliable probe of the average
    ionization state of the IGM. Comparing our model for LAEs with a range of
    observational data we find that the favoured reionization histories are
    our previously advocated Late and Very Late reionization histories, in
    which reionization finishes rather rapidly at around z &gt; 6.</P>
