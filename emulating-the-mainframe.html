    <H1>Emulating the mainframe</H1>

    <DIV>
      November 24, 2019
    </DIV>

    <DIV>
      <P>After participating in IBM's <A href=
      "https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/master-the-mainframe">
      Master the Mainframe</A> competition (which gives users access to a
      <A href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/MGYBLW61">z14</A> machine
      running <A href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/os">z/OS</A>),
      I was keen to learn more about mainframes. Compared to a lot of
      computing hardware these days, mainframes are still very much the domain
      of large corporate entities such as banks, so emulation is probably the
      most accessible way to spin up your own big iron. However, getting a
      personal copy of the proprietory z/OS is expensive (although there are
      options such as <A href=
      "https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSTQBD_12.0.0/com.ibm.zdt.install.doc/topics/zdt_pe.html">
      ZD&amp;T</A>). Fortunately, some of the older IBM operating systems are
      now in the public domain, including MVS (<EM>Multiple Virtual
      Storage</EM>) up to version 3.8j. In this blog post I will detail my
      experience with setting up an emulator called <A href=
      "http://www.hercules-390.org/">Hercules</A> to run an MVS distrubtion,
      and some of the fun I've had compiling and running programs on my own
      mainframe.</P>

      <P>I should note that there are many useful resources out there which go
      into more detail than I will, covering all things mainframe; in
      particular I highly recommend the YouTube channel of <A href=
      "https://www.youtube.com/user/moshe5760/featured">moshix</A> for some
      excellent tutorials on using Hercules and MVS.</P>

      <HR>

      <H3>History</H3>

      <P>The first commerically available mainframe was the <A href=
      "https://www.thocp.net/hardware/univac.htm">UNIVAC I</A> made in 1951.
      IBM's first mainframes were the <A href=
      "https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ibm700series/transform/">
      700 series</A>, led by the IBM 701 scientific computer released in 1952.
      Unlike modern supercomputer clusters (such as the IBM-built <A href=
      "https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/">Summit</A>), the mainframe has
      historically been targeted at high-throughput computing (HTC) rather
      than high-performance computing (HPC). For example, mainframes have been
      adopted throughout the finance and banking industry to provide reliable
      transaction services.</P>

      <P>In this post we will be emulating the IBM 3033 hardware, running the
      MVS operating system. First announced in 1977 and referred to as
      "<EM>The Big One</EM>", the 3033 processor boasted a CPU cycle time of
      58 ns (about 17 MHz).</P>

      <DIV style="text-align: center"><IMG src=
      "images/IBM_3033_with_users.jpg" alt="IBM 3033">
      </DIV>

      <P>Image from the IBM Corporate Archives* showing some users interacting
      with an IBM 3033 mainframe. For more information about mainframes and
      IBM's role in their development, I highly recommend visiting their
      <A href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/index.html">Coporate Archives
      page</A>.</P>

      <H3>Setting up Hercules and MVS 3.8j Turnkey</H3>

      <P>In what follows I will try to keep the information
      host-system-agnostic, because in theory the Hercules emulator should run
      on UNIX-like (e.g. Linux, MacOS, etc.) and Windows systems alike. To get
      started we will need to:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>install <A href=
        "http://www.hercules-390.org/hercinst.html">Hercules</A> on the host
        system,
        </LI>

        <LI>download the <A href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/">MVS 3.8j Turnkey
        4-</A> distribution,
        </LI>

        <LI>install a <A href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270">3270</A> terminal emulator.
        </LI>
      </OL>

      <P>The Hercules webpage has detailed instructions for installing the
      emulator on different host systems. The MVS distribution that we will be
      using was originally created by Volke Banke, including all the necessary
      software and Hercules integration to run MVS out-of-the-box. This
      distribution has then been updated and further automated by Juergen
      Winkelmann. Make sure to download the "<A href=
      "http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/tk4-_v1.00_current.zip">Current TK4-</A>"
      version, as this has all the latest patches pre-installed. Finally, in
      order to interact with your emulated mainframe you will need an emulator
      for the 3270 IBM terminal. There are a number of options out there for
      this, I'm using <A href="http://x3270.bgp.nu/">x3270</A>. I recommend
      having a look through the <A href=
      "http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/MVS_TK4-_v1.00_Users_Manual.pdf">Turnkey User
      Manual</A> before starting.</P>

      <P>The good news is that the MVS Turnkey distribution is extremely well
      integrated with Hercules, and all of the IPL'ing (<EM>Initial Program
      Load</EM>, c.f. bootloading) has been automated for us. Practically
      speaking, this means you should be able to boot up your mainframe just
      by using the provided <CODE>mvs</CODE> scripts in the <CODE>tk4-</CODE>
      directory (<CODE>mvs.bat</CODE> for Windows users, and the shell script
      <CODE>mvs</CODE> for *nix users). After starting these scripts from the
      command prompt of your choosing, you will see lots of start-up messages
      printed to the console. Hopefully you should eventually see the
      following, which means you are ready to logon to your system:</P>

      <P>At this point you can fire up your 3270 emulator, and point it to
      connect to port 3270 on your machine (e.g. <CODE>localhost:3270</CODE>,
      or <CODE>127.0.0.1:3270</CODE>). As the first user logging on to the
      system you will need to press the <CODE>RESET</CODE> and
      <CODE>CLEAR</CODE> keys on your 3270 emulator in order to be presented
      with a logon prompt. Note: the 3270 terminal had a number of keys that
      may not be present on your modern keyboard, so the emulator that you use
      may have special keybindings in order to use them.</P>

      <P>We are going to use the <CODE>HERC02</CODE> default user (password
      <CODE>CUL8TR</CODE>):</P>

      <DIV class="code">
        <PRE><CODE>Logon ===&gt; HERC02

ENTER CURRENT PASSWORD FOR HERC02-
CUL8TR</CODE></PRE>
      </DIV>

      <P>Having successfully logged on to TSO (<EM>Time Sharing Option</EM>),
      you will be presented with a little menu of TSO Applications. Choose
      option 1, RFE (<EM>REVIEW Front End</EM>), by hitting enter on:</P>

      <DIV class="code">
        <PRE><CODE>Option ===&gt; 1</CODE></PRE>
      </DIV>

      <P>From here we're ready to start playing with our mainframe!</P>

      <H3>Getting around the system with RFE</H3>

      <P>TSO is a system that allows multiple users to access and use a
      mainframe simultaneously. Much like UNIX, it provides a command line for
      submitting programs for execution. However, it is generally more
      convenient to use a <EM>productivity tool</EM> to interact with the
      system. These tools are a text-based user interface somewhere in between
      the command-line and a full windowing graphical user interface. Users of
      modern z/OS systems may be familiar in particular with <CODE>ISPF</CODE>
      (<EM>Interactive System Productivity Facility</EM>) and
      <CODE>SDSF</CODE> (<EM>System Display and Search Facility</EM>), however
      these are both proprietory IBM programs which require a license. We will
      instead be using an open source facility maintained by Greg Price called
      <CODE>REVIEW</CODE>, and we will interact with it using the front-end
      <CODE>RFE</CODE>:</P>

      <DIV style="text-align: center"><IMG src="images/using_RFE.png" alt=
      "RFE">
      </DIV>

      <P>As you can see from the RFE main menu, we can use this program to
      manage our files (called <EM>Data sets</EM> in mainframe jargon) as well
      as execute our programs on TSO.</P>

      <H3>Next time... [UPDATE: April 10 2021]</H3>

      <P>I was originally planning to write further posts to describe my
      experiences getting set up with some of the compilers that come with the
      Turnkey distribution: using them to write, compile and run some fun
      programs written in FORTRAN IV, COBOL and C. Unfortunately life and the
      pandemic have got in the way, so it may be some time before I return to
      this project.</P>
