Although no Lyα transmission is detected, Lyβ spikes are present which has led to claims that the gas along this trough must be ionized. Using high resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations in large volumes, we show that in a scenario where reionization ends late ($z \sim 5.2$), our simulations can reproduce troughs as long as observed. In this model, we find that the troughs are caused by islands of neutral hydrogen. Small ionized holes within the neutral islands allow for the transmission of Lyβ. We have also modelled the Lyα emitter population around the simulated troughs, and show that there is a deficit of Lyα emitters close to the trough as is observed.</p></div><a href="/long-troughs-in-the-lyman-α-forest-below-redshift-6-due-to-islands-of-neutral-hydrogen.html" class="w3-hover-opacity">read more...</a></div><div class="summary"><h2><a href="/modelling-the-observed-luminosity-function-and-clustering-evolution-of-ly-α-emitters-growing-evidence-for-late-reionization.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="w3-text-blue-gray">Modelling the observed luminosity function and clustering evolution of Ly α emitters: growing evidence for late reionization</a></h2><div class="date">February 17, 2019</div><div class="post"><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We model the high-redshift ($z &gt; 5$) Ly α-emitting galaxy (LAE) population using the empirical rest-frame equivalent width distribution. We calibrate to the observed luminosity function and angular correlation function at $z = 5.7$ as measured by the SILVERRUSH survey. This allows us to populate the high-dynamic-range Sherwood simulation suite with LAEs, and to calculate the transmission of their Ly α emission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use this simulated population to explore the effect of the IGM on high-redshift observations of LAEs, and make predictions for the narrow-band filter redshifts at $z = 6.6$, $7.0$, and $7.3$. Comparing our model with existing observations, we find a late reionization is suggested, consistent with the recent low optical depth derived from the cosmic microwave background by the Planck collaboration and the opacity fluctuations in the Ly α forest. We also explore the role of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the large volume of gas that is infalling on to the host halo versus the IGM in attenuating the Ly α signal, finding that a significant fraction of the attenuation is due to the CGM and infalling gas, which increases towards the end of reionization, albeit with a large scatter across the mock LAE population.</p></div><a href="/modelling-the-observed-luminosity-function-and-clustering-evolution-of-ly-α-emitters-growing-evidence-for-late-reionization.html" class="w3-hover-opacity">read more...</a></div><div class="summary"><h2><a href="/lyman-α-emitters-gone-missing-the-different-evolution-of-the-bright-and-faint-populations.html" style="text-decoration: none;" class="w3-text-blue-gray">Lyman-α emitters gone missing: the different evolution of the bright and faint populations</a></h2><div class="date">June 14, 2018</div><div class="post"><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We model the transmission of the Lyman-alpha line through the circum- and intergalactic media around dark matter haloes expected to host Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at $z \gt 5.7$, using the high-dynamic-range Sherwood simulations. We find very different CGM environments around more massive haloes ($\sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) compared to less massive haloes ($\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$) at these redshifts, which can contribute to a different evolution of the Lyman-alpha transmission from LAEs within these haloes. Additionally we confirm that part of the differential evolution could result from bright LAEs being more likely to reside in larger ionized regions. We conclude that a combination of the CGM environment and the IGM ionization structure is likely to be responsible for the differential evolution of the bright and faint ends of the LAE luminosity function at $z \gt 6$. More generally, we confirm the suggestion that the self-shielded neutral gas in the outskirts of the host halo can strongly attenuate the Lyman-alpha emission from high redshift galaxies. We find that this has a stronger effect on the more massive haloes hosting brighter LAEs. The faint-end of the LAE luminosity function is thus a more reliable probe of the average ionization state of the IGM. Comparing our model for LAEs with a range of observational data we find that the favoured reionization histories are our previously advocated Late and Very Late reionization histories, in which reionization finishes rather rapidly at around $z \sim 6$.</p></div><a href="/lyman-α-emitters-gone-missing-the-different-evolution-of-the-bright-and-faint-populations.html" class="w3-hover-opacity">read more...</a></div></div><footer><div class="w3-container w3-center w3-xxlarge footer" id="block"><div class="w3-show-inline-block"><div class="w3-bar w3-mobile"><a href="https://github.com/lewis-weinberger"><i class="fa fa-github w3-hover-opacity w3-padding-small"></i></a><a href="https://bitbucket.org/lweinberger/"><i class="fa fa-bitbucket w3-hover-opacity w3-padding-small"></i></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewis-weinberger-119923194"><i class="fa fa-linkedin w3-hover-opacity w3-padding-small"></i></a></div><div class="w3-bar w3-mobile"><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7312-4595"><i class="ai ai-orcid w3-hover-opacity w3-padding-small"></i></a><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Weinberger%2C+L+H"><i class="ai ai-arxiv w3-hover-opacity w3-padding-small"></i></a><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Weinberger%2C%20Lewis%20H.%22"><i class="ai ai-ads w3-hover-opacity w3-padding-small"></i></a></div></div><p class="w3-small">© 2019 Lewis Weinberger <a class="cc-button" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"><img src="https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/80x15.png" class="w3-hover-opacity w3-hover-white" /></a><br />This website is built with <a href="http://haunt.dthompson.us" class="w3-hover-opacity">Haunt</a>, a static site generator written in <a href="https://gnu.org/software/guile" class="w3-hover-opacity">Guile Scheme</a>.<br />Powered by the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp" class="w3-hover-opacity">w3.css</a> framework.</p></div></footer></div></body>
